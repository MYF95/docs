# Your application API

The API is the way the outside world interact with your system, and any server-side application needs one.
With Booster, you don't need to worry about it: _it is created for you_ and evolves with your code _automatically_.

When you finish deploying your application using the `boost deploy` command, it will print useful information needed to 
use your API. It will be shown under the "Outputs" section.

```sh
Outputs:
<application name>.httpURL = https://<API ID>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/<environment name>
<application name>.websocketURL = wss://<API ID>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/<environment name>
<application name>.clientID = abcdXjk1234
```

The meaning of those values are:

- **httpURL**: This is the main URL of your application. You will need it to interacting with the 
authentication/authorization API and to send commands and read model queries.
- **websocketURL**: This is the web socket URL you will need to use to subscribe to your read models and receive
them every time they are updated in real time 
- **clientID**: This parameter is specific for the AWS provider (so you will see only if you used that provider) and is 
needed only for the `auth/sign-up` and `auth/sign-in` endpoints.

For details, see the following sections.

## Authentication and Authorization API

The following endpoints are provisioned if your application have at least one role defined. For more information about how
to use roles to restrict the access to your application, see the section [Authentication and Authorization](#authentication-and-authorization).

### Sign-up
Register a user in your application. After a successful invocation, an email will be sent to the user's inbox
with a confirmation link. **Users's won't be able to sign-in before they click in that link**.
#### Endpoint
```http request
POST https://<httpURL>/auth/sign-up
```
#### Request body
```json
{
	"clientId": "string",
	"username": "string",
	"password": "string",
	"userAttributes": {
   		"roles": ["string"]
	}
}
```

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
_clientId_ | The application client Id that you got as an output when the application was deployed.
_username_ | The username of the user you want to register. It **must be an email**.
_password_ | The password the user will use to later login into your application and get access tokens.
_userAttributes_ | Here you can specify the attributes of your user. These are: <br/> - _roles_  An array of roles this user will have. You can only specify here roles with the property `allowSelfSignUp = true`


#### Response
An empty body

#### Errors
> Sign-up error response body example: Not specifying an email as username.

```json
{
    "__type": "InvalidParameterException",
    "message": "Username should be an email."
}
```

You will get an HTTP status code different from 2XX and a body with a message telling you the reason of the error.

### Sign-in
Allows your users to get tokens to be able to make request to restricted endpoints.
Remember that before a user can be signed in into your application, **its email must be confirmed**

#### Endpoint
```http request
POST https://<httpURL>/auth/sign-in
```
#### Request body
```json
{
	"clientId":"string",
	"username":"string",
	"password":"string"
}
```

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
_clientId_ | The application client Id that you got as an output when the application was deployed.
_username_ | The username of the user you want to sign in. It must be previously signed up
_password_ | The password used to sign up the user.

#### Response
```json
{
    "accessToken": "string",
    "expiresIn": "string",
    "refreshToken": "string",
    "tokenType": "string"
}
```

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
_accessToken_ | The token you can use to access restricted resources. It must be sent in the `Authorization` header (prefixed with the `tokenType`)
_expiresIn_ | The period of time, in seconds, after which the token will expire
_refreshToken_ | The token you can use to get a new access token after it has expired.
_tokenType_ | The type of token used. It is always `Bearer`

###### Errors
> Sign-in error response body example: Login of an user that has not been confirmed

```json
{
    "__type": "UserNotConfirmedException",
    "message": "User is not confirmed."
}
```

You will get a HTTP status code different from 2XX and a body with a message telling you the reason of the error.

### Sign-out
Finalizes the user session by cancelling their tokens.

###### Endpoint
```http request
POST https://<httpURL>/auth/sign-out
```
###### Request body
> Sign-out request body

```json
{
	"accessToken":"string"
}
```

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
_accessToken_ | The access token you get in the sign-in call.

###### Response
An empty body
###### Errors
> Sign-out error response body example: Invalid access token specified

```json
{
    "__type": "NotAuthorizedException",
    "message": "Invalid Access Token"
}
```

You will get a HTTP status code different from 2XX and a body with a message telling you the reason of the error.

 

## Commands and ReadModels API
 
This is the main API of your application, as it allows you to:

 - _Modify_ data by **sending commands**
 - _Read_ data by **querying read models**
 - _Receive data in real time_ by **subscribing to read models** 
 
All this is done through [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), a nice query language for APIs that has useful advantages over simple REST APIs.

If you are not familiar with GraphQL, then, first of all, don't worry! 
_Using_ a GraphQL API is simple and straightforward.
_Implementing it_ on the server side is the hardest part, as you need to define your schema, operation, resolvers, etc.
Luckily, you can forget about that because it is already done by Booster.
 
<aside class="notice">
The GraphQL API is fully <strong>auto-generated</strong> based on your <em>commands</em> and <em>read models</em>
</aside>

### Relationship between GraphQL operations and commands and read models
GraphQL defines three kinds of operations that you can use: _mutations_, _queries_, and _subscriptions_. 

The names are pretty meaningful, but we can say that you use a `mutation` when you want to change data, a `query` when you want to get
data on-demand, and a `subscription` when you want to receive data at the moment it is updated.

Knowing this, you can infer the relationship between those operations and your Booster components:

- You _send_ a **command** using a **mutation**
- You _read_ a **read model** using a **query**
- You _subscribe_ to a **read model** using a **subscription** 

### How to send GraphQL request
GraphQL uses two existing protocols: 

- _HTTP_ for `mutation` and `query` operations
- _WebSocket_ for `subscription` operations

The reason for the WebSocket protocol is that, in order for subscriptions to work, there must be a way for the server to send data
to clients when it is changed. HTTP doesn't allow that, as it is the client the one which always initiates the request.
 
This is the reason why Booster provisions two main URLs: the **httpURL** and the **websocketURL** (you can see them after
deploying your application). You need to use the "httpURL" to send GraphQL queries and mutations, and the "websocketURL"
to send subscriptions.

Therefore:

- To send a GraphQL mutation/query, you send an HTTP request to _"<httpURL>/graphql"_, with _method POST_, and a _JSON-encoded body_ with the mutation/query deatils.
- To send a GraphQL subscription, you first connect to the _websocketURL_, and then send a _JSON-encoded message_ with the subscription details.

Check the following section for details and examples.

<aside class="notice">
You normally don't need to deal with this low-level details. There are plenty of GraphQL clients for sending request manually
(like <a href="https://postwoman.io/">Postwoman</a>) or libraries you can use in the client-side of your application
(like <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/">Apollo</a>)
</aside>

### Sending commands

As mentioned in the previous section, we need to use a "mutation" to send a command. The structure of a mutation (the body
of the request) is the following:

```graphql
mutation {
  command_name(input: {
    input_field_list
  })
}
```

Where:

- _command_name_ is the name of the class corresponding to the command you want to send
- _field_list_ is list of pairs in the form of `fieldName: fieldValue` containing the data of your command. The field names
correspond to the names of the properties you defined in the command class. 

Check the examples where we send a command named "ChangeCart" that will add/remove an item to/from a shopping cart. The 
command requires the ID of the cart (`cartId`), the item identifier (`sku`) and the quantity of units we are adding/removing
(`quantity`).

<aside class="notice">
Remember that in case you want to send a command that is restricted to a specific set of roles, you must send the <strong>access
token</strong> in the <strong>"Authorization"</strong> header: <em>"Authorization: Bearer &lt;token retrieved upon sign-in&gt;"</em>
</aside>

> Using a GraphQL-specific client:

```
URL: "<httpURL>/graphql"
```
```graphql
mutation {
  ChangeCart(input: {
    cartId: "demo"
    sku: "ABC_01"
    quantity: 2
  })
}
```

> Equivalent bare HTTP request:

```
URL: "<httpURL>/graphql"
METHOD: "POST"
```
```json
{
  "query":"mutation { ChangeCart(input: { cartId: \"demo\" sku: \"ABC_01\" quantity: 2 }) }"
}
```

> Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "ChangeCart": true
  }
}
```

### Reading read models

To read a specific read model, we need to use a "query" operation. The structure of the "query" (the body
of the request) is the following:

```graphql
query {
  read_model_name(id: "<id of the read model>") {
    selection_field_list
  }
}
```

Where:

- _read_model_name_ is the name of the class corresponding to the read model you want to retrieve.
- _&lt;id of the read model&gt;_ is the ID of the specific read model instance you are interested in.
- _selection_field_list_ is a list with the names of the specific read model fields you want to get as response.

Check the examples where we send a query to read a read model named "CartReadModel" whose ID is "demo" and we get back as
response its `id` and the list of cart `items`

<aside class="notice">
Remember that in case you want to query a read model that is restricted to a specific set of roles, you must send the <strong>access
token</strong> in the <strong>"Authorization"</strong> header: <em>"Authorization: Bearer &lt;token retrieved upon sign-in&gt;"</em>
</aside>

> Using a GraphQL-specific client:

```
URL: "<httpURL>/graphql"
```
```graphql
query {
  CartReadModel(id: "demo") {
    id
    items
  }
}
```

> Equivalent bare HTTP request:

```
URL: "<httpURL>/graphql"
METHOD: "POST"
```
```json
{
  "query":"query { CartReadModel(id: \"demo\") { id items } }"
}
```

> Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "CartReadModel": {
      "id": "demo",
      "items": [
        {
          "sku": "ABC_01",
          "quantity": 2
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Subscribing to read models

To subscribe to a specific read model, we need to use a "subscription" operation, and it must be _sent through the **websocketURL**_.


Before sending any subscription, you need to _connect_ to the web socket to open the two-way communication channel. This connection
is done differently depending on the client/library you use to manage web sockets. In this section, we will show examples 
using the ["wscat"](https://github.com/websockets/wscat) command line program. 

Once you have connected successfully, you can use this channel to:

- Send the subscription messages
- Listen for messages sent by the server with data corresponding to your active subscriptions. 

The structure of the "subscription" (the body of the message) is exactly the same as the "query" operation:

```graphql
subscription {
  read_model_name(id: "<id of the read model>") {
    selection_field_list
  }
}
```

Where:

- _read_model_name_ is the name of the class corresponding to the read model you want to subscribe to.
- _&lt;id of the read model&gt;_ is the ID of the specific read model instance you are interested in.
- _selection_field_list_ is a list with the names of the specific read model fields you want to get when data is sent back to you.

In the following examples we use ["wscat"](https://github.com/websockets/wscat) to connect to the web socket and send a subscription
to the read model `CartReadModel` with ID "demo"

<aside class="notice">
Remember that in case you want to subscribe to a read model that is restricted to a specific set of roles, you must send, 
in the <em>connection operation</em>, the <strong>access token</strong> in the <strong>"Authorization"</strong> header: 
<em>"Authorization: Bearer &lt;token retrieved upon sign-in&gt;"</em>
</aside>

> Connecting to the web socket:

```sh
 wscat -c <websocketURL>
```

> Sending a message with the subscription

```json
{"query": "subscription { CartReadModel(id:\"demo\") { id items } }" }
```

After a successful subscription, you won't receive anything in return. Now, every time the read model you subscribed to
is modified, a new incoming message will appear in the socket with the updated version of the read model. This message
will have exactly the same format as if you were done a query with the same parameters.

Following the previous example, we now send a command (using a "mutation" operation) that adds
a new item with sku "ABC_02" to the `CartReadModel`. After it has been added, we receive the updated version of the read model through the
socket.

> Send the Command

```
URL: "<httpURL>/graphql"
```
```graphql
mutation {
  ChangeCart(input: {
    cartId: "demo"
    sku: "ABC_02"
    quantity: 3
  })
}
```

> The following message appears in the socket

```json
{
  "data": {
    "CartReadModel": {
      "id": "demo",
      "items": [
        {
          "sku": "ABC_01",
          "quantity": 2
        },
        {
          "sku": "ABC_02",
          "quantity": 3
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
